\textbf{Microfabrication (ECE 5221) Homework 7}

\textbf{Due 4/11/23}

\textbf{John Gardner}

\

\textbf{1) Photoresists}

\textbf{1a) Lift-off with single photoresist}

Briefly explain why a lift-off with a negative photoresist generally works better than using a positive photoresist.
Use a sketch to explain the answer. 

\

Negative photoresist usually works better because light leaks from the exposed part into parts of the photoresist covered by the mask.
This leads to an angle at the feature edges,
which slope away from the top for positive photoresist,
and towards the middle for negative photoresist.
This means that for the positive case,
deposited metal will coat this slope,
and for the negative case, the deposited metal will have a gap,
since it can't cover a slope that isn't exposed vertically.
A picture to illustrate:


\includegraphics[scale=0.2,angle=270]{./posVSneg.jpg}

Positive vs. negative photoresist and metal deposition.
Negative photoresist has a gap between metal on the photoresist and metal on the substrate
while positive photoresist has a continuous layer of metal covering both the photoresist and the substrate.


\


\textbf{1b) Lift-off with two photoresist}


\



\includegraphics[scale=0.2,angle=180]{./doubleLayerPr.jpg}

Metal deposition with two layers of positive photoresist.
The top layer is less sensitive to light and hence does not dissolve as much.
The lower layer is more sensitive to light and hence dissolves more.
This leaves an overhang from the top layer of photoresist to the substrate.
When one deposits metal on such structure, there is a gap left in this overhang.
This makes lift-off easier. 

\

\textbf{2) Photolithography}

A 0.125 mm thick photoresist layer is to be patterned using a photomask.
The distance between the mask and resist is initially 1.7 $\mu$m.
The H-line of a mercury vapor lamp is used for exposure.

\


\textbf{2a) Feature size}

Calculate the minimum feature size achievable with this setup.
Show your work with units. 

\

We use the Fresnel Diffraction model:
\begin{align*}
  R &= \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{\lambda (s + z/2) } \\
  &= \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{ 404.7 \times 10^-9\text{ m} \big(1.7\times 10^{-6} \text{ m} 
    + \frac{0.125\times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}{2} \big) } \\
  &= 7.646 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}.
\end{align*}

\

\textbf{2b) Variables}

Now three different variables are being investigated to improve the minimum feature size.
Which one should be selected to achieve the smallest possible feature size?

\

Let's calculate R for the I-line of the mercury vapor lamp: 
\begin{align*}
  R &= \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{ 365.4 \times 10^-9\text{ m} \big(1.7\times 10^{-6} \text{ m}
    + \frac{0.125\times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}{2} \big) } \\
  &= 7.26 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}.
\end{align*}

\

We know that the G-line of the vapor lamp has a higher wavelength,
and since $\lambda$ shows up in the numerator under the square root function which increases with increased argument,
we know that this will yield a larger resolution,
so we know this won't be better than the I-line.

Now let's calculate R for a distance between resist and mask of 0.9 $\mu$m:

\begin{align*}
  R &= \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{ 404.7 \times 10^-9\text{ m} \big(0.9\times 10^{-6} \text{ m}
    + \frac{0.125\times 10^{-3} \text{ m}}{2} \big) } \\
  &= 7.646 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}.
\end{align*}
Using the I-line in the mercury vapor lamp gives the best result.
Let's do that. 

\

\textbf{2c) Exposure method}

Contact exposure is considered as another option.
Explain the differences between contact and proximity exposure method.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?

\

Contact exposure means the mask is touching the photoresist layer,
there is no gap so in the above calculations, $s=0$.

The main advantage of contact lithography is that it allows for higher resolution.
With no gap between the mask and the photoresist, 
light doesn't hit the photoresist at an angle, 
so the pattern transfer is more exact. 
This may be an advantage for lift-off when using a positive photoresist,
as the slopes in the features shown above will be vertical or very close to vertical.
The disadvantage is that touching the photoresist may damage the mask.
There may be existing features from previous steps in the microfabrication process, 
and these may scratch the mask, 
or the mask may damage them.

The main advantage of proximity exposure is that it avoids the problems of contact lithography - the mask won't be damaged by the wafer or vice versa.
The main disadvantage is the lower resolution.
Having a gap means unwanted light can hit the photoresist at an angle underneath the mask.

\

\textbf{2d Other methods}

What other methods can be used to further minimize the feature size?
Only those that use a mask should be considered.


\

One method we did not consider above was using a thinner photoresist.
If excess light exposes the photoresist at an angle,
reducing the height of the photoresist will reduce the x-component
of the unwanted exposure,
improving resolution.
One could also use phase-shift lithography.
This means making certain parts of the mask thinner or thicker,
in order to manage light scattering.
Another method is nanoimprint lithography,
which uses heat or direct physical imprinting of a polymer instead of light for pattern transfer.
Also one could use electron beam lithography which uses a beam of electrons instead of light.

\

\textbf{3) Layer Etching}

\textbf{3a) Wet Etchants}

Explain the difference between isotropic and anisotropic silicon etchants and
how does the etchant selection impact the microwell fabrication?

\

Isotropic etching etches in all directions at the same rate while 
anisotropic etching etches in one direction faster than others.
We show this in the drawing below where the isotropic etch etches faster
vertically.
If one were to make a well with vertical or at least,
walls that do not erode away underneath the etch mask,
one would choose a vertical isotropic etchant.

\textbf{3b) Potassium hydroxide}

Calculate the depth and volume of silicon removed when etched in
40\% KOH solution at 70 $^\circ$C.

\

Using the picture from lecture we know that the structure will be etched
in a pyramid form as in the picture: 

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./etchLecture.png}

\

The height of this pyramid is
\begin{align*}
  h &= \tan(54.7^\circ) \times 10 \mu\text{m} \\
  &= 0.1412 \mu\text{m}
\end{align*}
If we etch for 60 minutes in the (100) plane we go deeper than this height,
so we must stop our calculation at this time and switch to only considering
the (111) plane.
This time happens at 
\begin{align*}
  t' &= \frac{0.1412 \mu\text{ m}}{0.599 \mu\text{m/min} } \\
  &= 23.58 \text{ min}
\end{align*}
Then etching in the (111) plane for 60 - 23.58 min gives
\begin{align*}
  d &= 36.42 \text{ min} \times 0.009 \mu\text{m/min}  \\
  &= 0.328 \mu\text{m}
\end{align*}
Then we need the hypotenuse of the triangle drawn here:

\includegraphics[scale=0.12,angle=180]{./triangles.jpg}

\begin{align*}
  b' &= \frac{ 0.328 \mu\text{m}} {\sin(54.7^\circ) } \\
  &= 0.402 \mu\text{m}
\end{align*}
The height adjustment is the same as the base adjustment. 
Then the volume of our pyramid is the original pyramid with slightly larger
base and height:
\begin{align*}
  V &= \frac{1}{3} (20+0.804 \mu\text{m})^2 \times (14.12 + .0402\mu\text{m}) \\
  &= 2095 \mu\text{m}^3
\end{align*}
